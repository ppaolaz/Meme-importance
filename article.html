        <h4>Internet content for beginners: understand entertaining internet content – the “memes”</h4>
        <div class="fifi">
        <img src="images/demo.jpeg">
        <p>“If you are new to the internet or have been using it for a while, you can learn a lot about entertaining content in this article. How many times has you seen a photo or a video that just didn’t make sense, so you ignored them… it’s time for you to start understanding “memes” and making your day better and filled with joy! “</p>
        <h3>What are memes?</h3>
        <p>Memes are an important part of the internet, but what are they? 85% of world population has heard about them, but 60% of them can’t even explain the term itself. There are multiple articles on this topic, but they are not really explaining memes well, they’re going around it - not stating it clearly and assuming readers already know about the topic. Here you can read everything you need to know about memes if you have never heard about the term, if you did hear about it but can’t really explain it well and if you wish to follow up on new trends and understand the entire internet better. First of all, a simple definition of a meme: <b>it is internet media content</b> (photo, drawing, video, <i>gif</i> , animation and similar) that is meant to make the user laugh or relate to it. </p>
        <h3>What does that actually mean?</h3>
        <p>Now what does it mean? Well, I believe most of us know what sitcoms are: literally translated as “situation comedy”, TV shows in which everyday life situations are made fun of and their goal is to make the audience laugh. Some examples of sitcoms are: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Full house,</li>
                <li>Big bang theory,</li>
                <li>How I met your mother,</li>
                <li>Everybody loves raymond,</li>
                <li>The Simpsons,</li>
            </ol>
              <p> all Disney shows and similar. Why am I bringing this up? Because memes are almost the same. To relate to something means that you have seen that situation before, in your own life. For example, if there is a scene in a sitcom where a character is sneaking in the middle of the night to get snacks and you have done that at least once in your life too, you will relate.</p>
        <h3>Basic rules of understanding a meme</h3>
        <p>This internet media content I keep talking about, the memes, are not so hard to figure out anymore, right? To understand a meme, you should first know some basic facts: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First rule of internet memes is that you do not necessarily know this people in your life personally. I showed my mom a meme once and she continuously started asking me: “Who is this man? Do I know him? Why is he playing the flute? Are you dating him?” You lose your motivation to interact with <i>boomers</i>  at all at this point. </li> <br/>
            <li>Second rule of the meme is - if there is text: it is important! Most memes with text do not make sense or are just not understandable without reading the text first. </li>
        </ol>
